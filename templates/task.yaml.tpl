         * Instruction provided at the top of the source file on IntelliJ.
         * Please note, the score displayed on INGInious is given for information only.
         * The tests will be modified for the final evaluation.
         * We therefore advise you to verify your code locally with the provided tests plus possibly your own additional tests.
         * Regularly save your code (even incomplete) by submitting on inginious to make a backup (rare SEB crash, but can happen, the intermediate inginious submission serves as a backup in this case).
         * It is also advised to check if your code meets the requested specification.
         * If a technical problem prevents you from progressing, report it to the supervisor without wasting time, after that will be too late.
         * Debug using small and easy unit tests provided in junit tests, it can also help to clarify the instructions.
